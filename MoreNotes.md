What will it take to get rid of the external transport host?
Either make MCU bigger or whatever?
Minimum load to put on software

Enfabrica was built off of Offload software very cheaply

Every-time we sell a chip right now, we need to sell an infra host and the infra host is more expensive than the chip
If we sell an FPGA it would be cheaper and not be bad, but an FPGA burns power as well

What can we do on-chip?
We could build an rNIC



Other shit:
UEC has a live transport and congestion control
Enfabrica doesn't have answers for this?..

Brooklyn vs UALink 3.2 / 6.4
- What makes Brooklyn more competitive?
  - Not sure right now



Antonis: 
Do we really think UALink is gonna be more (92% header) bandwidth efficient than 5 generations of NVLink?
